# Stochastic Assembler
This git repository contains the code for the stochastic assembler used in the paper "Designing 3D multicomponent self-assembling systems with signal-passing building blocks"

The C++ code was originally written by Joakim Bohlin, can be found in [https://github.com/Akodiat/polycubes](his git repo). That code was originally published in the paper [https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c09677]("Designing the Self-Assembly of Arbitrary Shapes Using Minimal Complexity Building Blocks")

The web app is based on Dr. Bohlin's code but has been adapted by Joshua Evans
